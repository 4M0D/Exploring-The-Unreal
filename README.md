# complex-analysis
Made from a desire to get an accessible introduction to complex analysis, this is a concise, student-written re-articulation of key ideas from Saff &amp; Snider. Aimed at peers and juniors (highschool graduates and new undergrads), emphasizing clarity, intuition, and the beauty of analytic functions without being carelessly informal.
