# complex-analysis
Made from a desire to get an accessible introduction to complex analysis, this is a concise, student-written re-articulation of key ideas from Saff &amp; Snider. Aimed at peers and juniors (high school graduates and new undergrads), it emphasizes clarity, intuition, and the beauty of analytic functions while maintaining conceptual depth.
