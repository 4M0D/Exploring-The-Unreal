# Exploring The Unreal

*A student-made guide to complex analysis â€” clear, concise, and curiosity-driven.*

We often meet complex numbers in high school, but rarely do we explore their functions the way we do with real ones. Eulerâ€™s formula is usually as far as we go â€” beautiful, but a little mysterious. This project is anattempt to go deeper and make sense of complex functions, extending the lens of calculus.

**Exploring the Unreal** is a compact re-articulation of the ideas in *Fundamentals of Complex Analysis* by Saff & Snider. It closely follows the structure of that text but expresses the material in my own words â€” focusing on clarity, visual understanding, and the reasoning behind key results. Some exercises and formalities are skipped in favor of a more direct flow. It's meant for fellow students, especially those just stepping into the subject.

### Should you read it?
The book assumes familarity with single variable calculus of real functions  as it is the first possible motivator for studying calculus on complex valued functions. The prior knowledge of epsilon-delta treatment of limits and vector calculus (intuition, as given in books like Grad, Div, Curl and All That by H.M. Schey) helped me to write this, but I have tried my best to not have these as essential prerequisites for enjoying the text.

### ðŸ“˜ Topics covered so far
- **Complex Numbers**: origin, representation, roots, and geometry
- **Towards Complex Calculus**: limits, differentiability, Cauchy-Riemann equations, and harmonic functions
- **Elementary Functions**: polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, trigonometric and logarithmic functions

Upcoming chapters:
- **Complex Integration**
- **Analytic Functions as Infinite Series**

### ðŸ›  Tools used
Written in LaTeX, using `lmodern` for the text and visuals made with Desmos, GeoGebra, and some hand-tuned figures.
