# Exploring The Unreal

*A student-made guide to complex analysis â€” clear and concise*

We often meet complex numbers in high school, but rarely do we explore their functions the way we do with real ones. Eulerâ€™s formula is usually as far as we go â€” beautiful, but a little mysterious. This project is an attempt to go deeper and make sense of complex functions, extending the lens of calculus.

**Exploring the Unreal** is a compact re-articulation of the ideas in *Fundamentals of Complex Analysis* by Saff & Snider. It closely follows the structure of that text but expresses the material in my own words â€” focusing on clarity, visual understanding, and the reasoning behind key results. It's meant for fellow students, especially those just stepping into the subject.

### Should you read it?
This text assumes familiarity with basic single-variable calculus of real functions â€” since thatâ€™s the natural gateway to calculus on complex-valued functions. Earlier exposure to epsilon-delta limits and intuitive vector calculus (like in *Div, Grad, Curl and All That* by H.M. Schey) helped me while writing, but Iâ€™ve done my best not to make them essential for enjoying the material.

### ðŸ“˜ Topics covered so far
- **Complex Numbers**: origin, representation, roots, and geometry
- **Towards Complex Calculus**: limits, differentiability, Cauchy-Riemann equations, and harmonic functions
- **Elementary Functions**: polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, trigonometric and logarithmic functions

Upcoming chapters:
- **Complex Integration**
- **Analytic Functions as Infinite Series**

### ðŸ›  Tools used
Written in LaTeX, using `lmodern` for the text and visuals made with Desmos, GeoGebra, and some hand-tuned figures.
