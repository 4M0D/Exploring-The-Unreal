# Exploring The Unreal

We often meet complex numbers in high school, but rarely do we explore their functions the way we do with real ones. This text is an attempt to go deeper and make sense of complex functions, extending the lens of calculus.

**Exploring the Unreal** is a compact re-articulation of the ideas in *Fundamentals of Complex Analysis* by Saff & Snider. It closely follows the structure of that text but expresses the ideas in my own words â€” focusing on clarity, visual understanding, and the reasoning behind key results. 

### Should you read it?
This text assumes familiarity with basic single-variable calculus of real functions , since thatâ€™s the natural gateway to calculus on complex-valued functions. Earlier exposure to epsilon-delta limits and intuitive vector calculus (like in *Div, Grad, Curl and All That* by H.M. Schey) helped me while writing, but Iâ€™ve done my best not to make them essential for enjoying the material.

### ðŸ“˜ Topics covered so far
- **Complex Numbers**: origin, representation, roots, and geometry
- **Towards Complex Calculus**: limits, differentiability, Cauchy-Riemann equations, and harmonic functions
- **Elementary Functions**: polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, trigonometric and logarithmic functions

Upcoming chapters:
- **Complex Integration**
- **Analytic Functions as Infinite Series**
